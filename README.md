# buildspace Solana NFT Drop Project
### Welcome üëã

Our goal for this project is to build a web application that lets a user connect their wallet, request an NFT, minting the NFT, and recieveing the NFT from our collection.

To start up the app follow these commands:

1. cd into the `app` folder
2. Run `npm install` at the root of your directory
3. Run `npm run start` to start the project

### Dependencies

- **Metaplex** will help us create and mint NFT, while **Candy Machine** will help us govern fair mints.
- [**Phantom Wallet**](https://phantom.app/) will be a bridge between our web app and Solana program. Without a connecting to a wallet we cannot communicate with the Solana blockchain.

### What is the .vscode Folder?
If you use VSCode to build your app, we included a list of suggested extensions that will help you build this project! Once you open this project in VSCode, you will see a popup asking if you want to download the recommended extensions :).
